  THIS ANTICHEAT HAS BEEN DISCOUNTIED
  I really just ran out of motivation to update it due to it not really being used on server
  I have started a new anticheat called Isolate, it's currently public, but it might become private soon.
  The new anticheat is kinda scuffed because its a scythe base again and USSR hasnt really been updating the anticheat so its a mess to fix.
  Also doesnt help that ive taken a 7 month break from really making anticheats, I have been making a private java cpvp client but thats coded in java...
  Anyways, this anticheat was fun to make, it was, was the best but minecraft keeps updating the API and destorying everything for developers.
